                <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                <p>Annikedel began in 2019 as a startup consulting firm
                     focused on helping early-stage companies grow and scale. We started by 
                     offering support services to startups of various shapes and sizes, 
                     from small revenue-generating businesses
                     to global-serving companies with annual revenues of up to $100 million.</p>
                     <p>Our founders collaborated with daring founders to build and scale
                         something from nothing, and we quickly became the go-to support partner 
                         for startup innovation in major cities around the world, such as Silicon
                          Valley, Milton Canada, Lagos Nigeria, among others. 
                        We were agile operators, community-led, and truly wanted to help.</p>
                        <p>As we continued to grow, we recognized that there was a 
                            need to support startup innovation across the African continent. 
                            The African ecosystem faces challenges in achieving sustained 
                            prosperity growth while dealing with high population growth and unemployment rates. 
                            That"s why we believe that startups, particularly those with a focus 
                            on technology and innovation, have the potential to change the narrative 
                            and create breakthrough opportunities for individuals and existing businesses, 
                            while also being employed by African governments.</p>
                   <p>We then pivoted towards becoming more than just a venture builder.
                     We became the driving force behind African Dynamism - a movement focused 
                     on promoting startup innovation across the African continent.
                      We believe that supporting startup innovation is critical 
                      for African Dynamism and the growth of the African continent. 
                      Our mission is to help founders build companies that support continental 
                      interests in sectors such as financial services, education, culture, 
                      agriculture, 
                    supply chain, industrials, and manufacturing.</p>
